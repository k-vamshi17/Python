						Operators and Expressions
				=====================================================
=>An Operator is a Symbol, which performs Some Operation on Values OR Variables OR Objects.
=>If Two or More Objects OR Variables OR Values Connected with an Operator then it is called Expression.
=>In Otherwords, An Expression is a Collection of Objects OR Variables OR Values Connected with an Operator.
=>In Python Programming, we hav 7 Types of Operators. They are

				1. Arithmetic Operators
				2. Assigment Operator
				3. Relational Operators (Comparision Operators)
				4. Logical Operators  (Comparision Operators)
				5. Bitwise Operators----Most Imp
				6. Membership Operators
						a) in Operator
						b) not in Operator
				7. Identity Operators
						a) is operator
						b) is not operator

Note-1: Python Programming Does not Support Unary Operators ( ++, - - ) of C, C++, Java, C#.net Lang.
Note-2: Python Programming Does not Support Ternary Operator of C,C++,Java,C#.net
											( Varname= Expr1? Expr2: Expr3)
NOTE-3: Python is Having  Its Own Ternary Operator-----if..else operator
NOTE-4: Python Supports SHORT HAND OPERATORS
