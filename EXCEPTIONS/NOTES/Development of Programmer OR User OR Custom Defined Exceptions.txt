Steps for Developing Programmer-Defined Exceptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step-1: Choose the Programmer-Defined Class 
Step-2: The Programmer-Defined Class  must Inherit the Exception handling Properties from Exception Class or Base 
              Exception Class and hence the programmer-defined class becomes programmer-Defined exception sub class
Step-3: Save the above Two Steps on Some File Name with an extension .py (FileName.py---Module Name)

Examples:
---------------
	class PINError(Exception):pass
	class LoginError(BaseException):pass
