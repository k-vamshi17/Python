				Inheriting the features of Base Class into Derived Class
			==============================================================
=>To Inherit the features of Base Class into Derived Class, we use the following Syntax.

		class <clsname-1>:
		     ---------------
		     ---------------
		class <clsname-2>:
		     ---------------
		     ---------------
		------------------------------
		------------------------------
		class <clsname-n>:
		     ---------------
		     ---------------
		
		class <clsname-n+1>(clsname-1, clsname-2,....clsname-n):
		     ---------------
		     ---------------
-----------------------
Explanation
-----------------------
=>Here clsname-1, clsname-2,....clsname-n are called Base OR Super Class.
=>Here clsname-n+1 is called Derived OR Sub Class.
=>Here all the Features of clsname-1, clsname-2,....clsname-n (Base Classes) are Inherited into clsname-n+1 and They 
    are available Virtually in clsname-n+1 and we can access them with all the Accessing Principles of OOPs.
=>when we develop any Inheritance Based application, It is always Recommened to create an object of Bottom Most 
   Derived Class bcoz inherits the Features of intermediate Base Classes and Base Class.
=>For Every Class in Python, There exist an Implicit Pre-Defined Super Class called "object" bcoz "object" class 
    Provides Garbage Collection Facility.
=>For the Data types of Python, object is the super data type.
