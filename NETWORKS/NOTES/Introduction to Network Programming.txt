					Network Programming
						OR
					Socket Programming
	============================================================================
=>The purpose of Network Programming is that "To share the data OR information between multiple devices which are located either in Same Network or in Different Network across universe".
--------------------------------------
=>Definition of Network
--------------------------------------
=>Collection of Inter-connected autonomous Computers connected with Server for Sharing the Data between Multiple devices  which are located either in Same Network or in Different Network across universe.
-------------------------------------------------
=>To Develop any Netwoking Application, we  develop Two types of Programs. They are

			1. Server Side Application.
			2. Client Side Application.
---------------------------------------------
1. Server Side Application.
---------------------------------------------
=>A Server Side Application is one which is always recevies the Request from Client Side Program, Process the Request and Gives response  back to the Client Side Program.
---------------------------------------------
2. Client Side Application.
---------------------------------------------
=>A Client Side Application is one, which is always Send Request to server Side Program and obtains response from  
   Server side Program.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of DNS (Domain Naming Service)
----------------------------------------------------------------
=>The DNS is the Name of the Physical machine, where server side program Sides
=>The default DNS of every computer is localhost.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of IP Address(Internet Protocol Address)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>The IP Address is one of the Numerical Address of Physical machine, where server side program Sides.
=>The Default IP Address of Physical machine is 127.0.0.1(loop back address).
---------------------------------------------
Definition of Port Number
---------------------------------------------
=>A Port Number is one of the Logical Numerical ID where server side program is running.
---------------------------------------------
=>Hence Every server side program must binds with certain (DNS/IP Address and portno).
=>Hence Every client side program must specify  (DNS/IP Address and portno) for communicating with server side 
    program.
