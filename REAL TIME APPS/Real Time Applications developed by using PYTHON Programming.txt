				Real Time Applications developed by using PYTHON Programming
			===================================================================
=>By using PYTHON programming Language and in Combination of Tools and Technologies, we develop the Following Applications.

			1. Development of Web Applications(Web Sites)
					a) Java Programming Lang------------->Tech: JDBC, Servlets,JSP,Spring,SpringBoot, Spring		(Sun Micro Sys-->Oracle corp)	  Micro Services
						
					b) C#.net Programming Lang---------->Tech:  ASP.net, ASP Micro Service....etc
					     (Micro Soft INC USA)
					c) PYTHON Programming Lang-------->Tech: Django,Flask,Bottle,Pyramid..etc
							The Reason for making PYTHON is popular is bcoz of More MODULES
							 Present in PYTHON Lang.
					[ Learning Python is nothing but Learning about MODULES]
