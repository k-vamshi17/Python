					Looping OR Iterative OR Repetative Stataments
			=======================================================
=>The purpose of Looping OR Iterative Statements is that " To Perform Certain Operation Repetedly OR Iteratively for 
    Finite Number of Times until Test Condition becomes False".
=>In Python programming, we have 2 Type of  Looping OR Iterative OR Repetative Stataments. They are

			1. while loop  OR  while ...else loop.
			2. for loop  or   for ...else loop
=>When We write any Program by using LOOPs, we must Remember 3 Points. They are
			
			i) Initlization Part (Where to Start )
			ii) Conditional Part ( Where to stop) 
			iii) Updation Part (Incr OR Decr)
